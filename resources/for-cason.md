# Tips for Effective Learning

1. Always try your best before asking for help.
2. If you're stuck and have tried hard, it’s okay to ask for help.
3. If you don’t understand a word, look it up! First, try to guess what it means. This helps you remember it better.
4. For math, try to figure it out yourself first. If you still can’t, ask your teacher or me for help.
5. Take breaks when you feel tired. A 15-minute break can help you focus better.
6. Keep your space quiet. Turn off your phone and find a calm spot to study. Ask your teacher if you can use a quieter room in the library.

### Always remember...

**Never give up!!!** You can do anything. Don't limit yourself!
