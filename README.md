# Notes for 2024-2025

**Disclaimer:** Most of these notes are restructured and reformatted using ChatGPT. However, I proof read everything before uploading them. Of course, always be skeptical of anything you read.

For the best viewing experience, open the markdown files using the Markdown Preview extension in VSCode. This extension supports syntax similar to LaTeX, which is used for mathematical symbols in these notes.
