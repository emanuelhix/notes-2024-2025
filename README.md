# Notes for 2024-2025

**Disclaimer:** These notes have been summarized and restructured by ChatGPT, but all the information is directly from my lectures.

For the best viewing experience, open the markdown files using the Markdown Preview extension in VSCode. This extension supports syntax similar to LaTeX, which is used for mathematical symbols in these notes.
