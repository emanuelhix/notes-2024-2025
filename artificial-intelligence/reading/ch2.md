#### Design Considerations

Typically, it's more effective to design performance measures based on how the actuaotr should change the environment, rather than how the actuator should behave.

#### Rationality

Defined by four ideas:
- The performance measure that defines what is successful
- The agent's built-in knowledge (it's prior knowledge, what it knows)
- The current percept-sequence, which is the history of everything the agent has percieved -- i.e., the things it remembers.
Can we say this is "learning?"
- The actions an agent can perform
