To find the equation of the tangent plane to a surface described by a vector function **r(u, v)** at a specific point determined by parameters **u** and **v**, follow these steps:

### 1. **Understand the Surface Parameterization**

Assume the surface is parameterized by:
\[
\mathbf{r}(u, v) = \langle x(u, v),\ y(u, v),\ z(u, v) \rangle
\]
where **u** and **v** are parameters that describe points on the surface.

### 2. **Compute the Partial Derivatives**

Find the partial derivatives of **r** with respect to **u** and **v**:
\[
\mathbf{r}_u = \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial u} = \left\langle \frac{\partial x}{\partial u},\ \frac{\partial y}{\partial u},\ \frac{\partial z}{\partial u} \right\rangle
\]
\[
\mathbf{r}_v = \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial v} = \left\langle \frac{\partial x}{\partial v},\ \frac{\partial y}{\partial v},\ \frac{\partial z}{\partial v} \right\rangle
\]
These vectors are tangent to the surface at the point **r(u, v)**.

### 3. **Find the Normal Vector**

Compute the cross product of the partial derivatives to obtain a normal vector **N** to the tangent plane:
\[
\mathbf{N} = \mathbf{r}_u \times \mathbf{r}_v
\]
This vector is perpendicular to both **r_u** and **r_v**, and hence normal to the tangent plane.

### 4. **Determine the Point of Tangency**

Let **P₀** be the point on the surface where you want to find the tangent plane:
\[
\mathbf{P}_0 = \mathbf{r}(u_0, v_0) = \langle x(u_0, v_0),\ y(u_0, v_0),\ z(u_0, v_0) \rangle
\]

### 5. **Formulate the Equation of the Tangent Plane**

Using the normal vector **N** and the point **P₀**, the equation of the tangent plane can be written as:
\[
\mathbf{N} \cdot (\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{P}_0) = 0
\]
Where **X** = \(\langle x, y, z \rangle\) is any point on the tangent plane.

In component form, if **N** = \(\langle A, B, C \rangle\) and **P₀** = \(\langle x_0, y_0, z_0 \rangle\), the equation becomes:
\[
A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + C(z - z_0) = 0
\]

### **Example**

Suppose you have a surface parameterized by:
\[
\mathbf{r}(u, v) = \langle u, v, u^2 + v^2 \rangle
\]
To find the tangent plane at the point corresponding to \( u = 1 \) and \( v = 2 \):

1. Compute the partial derivatives:
   \[
   \mathbf{r}_u = \langle 1, 0, 2u \rangle, \quad \mathbf{r}_v = \langle 0, 1, 2v \rangle
   \]
   At \( u = 1 \), \( v = 2 \):
   \[
   \mathbf{r}_u = \langle 1, 0, 2 \rangle, \quad \mathbf{r}_v = \langle 0, 1, 4 \rangle
   \]

2. Find the normal vector:
   \[
   \mathbf{N} = \mathbf{r}_u \times \mathbf{r}_v = \langle 1, 0, 2 \rangle \times \langle 0, 1, 4 \rangle = \langle -2, -4, 1 \rangle
   \]

3. Determine the point of tangency:
   \[
   \mathbf{P}_0 = \langle 1, 2, 1^2 + 2^2 \rangle = \langle 1, 2, 5 \rangle
   \]

4. Write the equation of the tangent plane:
   \[
   -2(x - 1) - 4(y - 2) + 1(z - 5) = 0 \\
   \Rightarrow -2x + 2 - 4y + 8 + z - 5 = 0 \\
   \Rightarrow -2x - 4y + z + 5 = 0
   \]

### **Conclusion**

By following these steps—computing the partial derivatives, finding their cross product to obtain the normal vector, and using the point-normal form—you can derive the equation of the tangent plane to any surface parameterized by **r(u, v)** at a given point.
