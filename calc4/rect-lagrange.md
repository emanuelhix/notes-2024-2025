To maximize the volume of a rectangular box subject to a constraint on the length and girth, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. 

Let's define:
- \( L \) = length of the box
- \( W \) = width of the box
- \( H \) = height of the box

The volume \( V \) of the box is given by:
\[
V = L \cdot W \cdot H
\]

The girth \( G \) of the box is given by:
\[
G = 2W + 2H
\]

According to the problem, the constraint on the dimensions is:
\[
L + G \leq 96
\]
Substituting the expression for girth, we have:
\[
L + 2W + 2H \leq 96
\]

To maximize the volume subject to this constraint, we can express our constraint as an equation:
\[
L + 2W + 2H = 96
\]
Now we will set up the Lagrange function:
\[
\mathcal{L}(L, W, H, \lambda) = L \cdot W \cdot H + \lambda (96 - L - 2W - 2H)
\]

Next, we take the partial derivatives and set them to zero:

1. \(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial L} = W \cdot H - \lambda = 0\)
2. \(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W} = L \cdot H - 2\lambda = 0\)
3. \(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial H} = L \cdot W - 2\lambda = 0\)
4. \(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = 96 - L - 2W - 2H = 0\)

From the first equation:
\[
\lambda = W \cdot H
\]

From the second equation:
\[
\lambda = \frac{L \cdot H}{2}
\]

From the third equation:
\[
\lambda = \frac{L \cdot W}{2}
\]

Setting the first two equations equal:
\[
W \cdot H = \frac{L \cdot H}{2}
\]
If \( H \neq 0 \), we can divide both sides by \( H \):
\[
W = \frac{L}{2}
\]

Setting the first and third equations equal:
\[
W \cdot H = \frac{L \cdot W}{2}
\]
If \( W \neq 0 \), we can divide both sides by \( W \):
\[
H = \frac{L}{2}
\]

Now we have:
\[
W = \frac{L}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad H = \frac{L}{2}
\]

Substituting \( W \) and \( H \) into the constraint:
\[
L + 2\left(\frac{L}{2}\right) + 2\left(\frac{L}{2}\right) = 96
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
L + L + L = 96
\]
\[
3L = 96 \implies L = 32
\]

Now substituting back to find \( W \) and \( H \):
\[
W = \frac{32}{2} = 16, \quad H = \frac{32}{2} = 16
\]

Thus, the dimensions of the package that maximize the volume are:
\[
L, W, H = 32, 16, 16
\]

Therefore, the dimensions of the package are:
\[
\boxed{32, 16, 16}
\]
