## Tracing 3-Dimensional Functions

1. **Trace where \( x = 0 \)**
   - Plot the function for the plane where \( x \) is zero.

2. **Trace where \( y = 0 \)**
   - Plot the function for the plane where \( y \) is zero.

3. **Trace interesting points where \( z = c \)**
   - Identify and plot the function for various constant values \( z = c \).

4. **Graphing Procedure**
   - First, graph the traces for \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \).
   - Then, graph the traces for \( z = c \) and shade the regions of interest.
