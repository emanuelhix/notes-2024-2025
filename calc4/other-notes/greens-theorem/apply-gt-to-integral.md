To evaluate the line integral \( \int_C x^4 \, dx + xy \, dy \) over the triangular region \( C \) using **Green's Theorem**, we need to express the given line integral as a double integral over the region enclosed by the curve \( C \).

### Step 1: Recall Green's Theorem
Green's Theorem relates a line integral around a simple closed curve \( C \) to a double integral over the region \( R \) enclosed by \( C \). Green's Theorem is given by:

\[
\int_C P(x, y) \, dx + Q(x, y) \, dy = \iint_R \left( \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \right) \, dA,
\]
where \( P(x, y) \) and \( Q(x, y) \) are the components of the vector field \( \mathbf{F} = (P, Q) \).

In our case, we are given:
\[
P(x, y) = x^4 \quad \text{and} \quad Q(x, y) = xy.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the partial derivatives

Now we compute the partial derivatives \( \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} \) and \( \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \).

1. \( \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (xy) = y \),
2. \( \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} (x^4) = 0 \) (since \( x^4 \) does not depend on \( y \)).

Thus, Green's Theorem becomes:
\[
\int_C x^4 \, dx + xy \, dy = \iint_R \left( y - 0 \right) \, dA = \iint_R y \, dA.
\]

### Step 3: Set up the region of integration

The region \( R \) is the triangular region with vertices \( (0, 0) \), \( (1, 0) \), and \( (0, 1) \). The boundary of this triangle consists of the line segments:

- From \( (0, 0) \) to \( (1, 0) \),
- From \( (1, 0) \) to \( (0, 1) \),
- From \( (0, 1) \) to \( (0, 0) \).

The equation of the line from \( (1, 0) \) to \( (0, 1) \) can be found by noting that it is a straight line with slope \( -1 \). Its equation is:
\[
y = 1 - x.
\]

Thus, the region \( R \) is bounded by \( x \in [0, 1] \) and for each \( x \), \( y \) ranges from 0 to \( 1 - x \).

### Step 4: Set up the double integral

Now, we can set up the double integral for \( \iint_R y \, dA \). In terms of \( x \) and \( y \), the integral is:
\[
\iint_R y \, dA = \int_0^1 \int_0^{1 - x} y \, dy \, dx.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the double integral

First, integrate with respect to \( y \):
\[
\int_0^{1 - x} y \, dy = \left[ \frac{y^2}{2} \right]_0^{1 - x} = \frac{(1 - x)^2}{2}.
\]

Now, integrate with respect to \( x \):
\[
\int_0^1 \frac{(1 - x)^2}{2} \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 (1 - 2x + x^2) \, dx.
\]

We can break this up into three integrals:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \int_0^1 1 \, dx - 2 \int_0^1 x \, dx + \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx \right).
\]

Now, compute each integral:
- \( \int_0^1 1 \, dx = 1 \),
- \( \int_0^1 x \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \),
- \( \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3} \).

Thus, the double integral becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( 1 - 2 \times \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 - 1 + \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Step 6: Conclusion

By Green's Theorem, the value of the line integral is equal to the value of the double integral, which we have computed to be \( \frac{1}{6} \).

Thus, the value of the line integral is \( \boxed{\frac{1}{6}} \).
