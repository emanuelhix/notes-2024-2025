To evaluate the line integral \( \oint_C \left( 5y - \sqrt{x^4 + 1} \right) \, dx + (8x + e^y) \, dy \) using Green's Theorem, we first recall the statement of Green's Theorem:

\[
\oint_C P \, dx + Q \, dy = \iint_R \left( \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \right) \, dA
\]

where \( P(x, y) = 5y - \sqrt{x^4 + 1} \) and \( Q(x, y) = 8x + e^y \), and \( R \) is the region enclosed by the curve \( C \).

### Step 1: Compute the partial derivatives
We need to compute \( \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} \) and \( \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \).

- For \( Q(x, y) = 8x + e^y \):
  \[
  \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( 8x + e^y \right) = 8
  \]

- For \( P(x, y) = 5y - \sqrt{x^4 + 1} \):
  \[
  \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( 5y - \sqrt{x^4 + 1} \right) = 5
  \]

### Step 2: Set up the double integral
Using Green's Theorem, we have:

\[
\oint_C P \, dx + Q \, dy = \iint_R \left( \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \right) \, dA = \iint_R \left( 8 - 5 \right) \, dA = \iint_R 3 \, dA
\]

Now, we need to find the area of the region \( R \), which is the disk defined by the equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \), a circle with radius 2.

### Step 3: Compute the area of the region \( R \)
The area \( A \) of a disk with radius \( r \) is given by:

\[
A = \pi r^2
\]

For \( r = 2 \), the area is:

\[
A = \pi (2)^2 = 4\pi
\]

### Step 4: Compute the double integral
Thus, the double integral becomes:

\[
\iint_R 3 \, dA = 3 \times \text{Area of } R = 3 \times 4\pi = 12\pi
\]

### Step 5: Account for the orientation of the curve
Green's Theorem assumes the curve \( C \) is oriented counterclockwise (positively oriented), but the problem states that \( C \) is oriented clockwise. Since the clockwise orientation is the opposite of the counterclockwise orientation, we need to negate the value of the integral. Therefore, the final result is:

\[
-\iint_R 3 \, dA = -12\pi
\]

### Final Answer:
The value of the line integral is \( \boxed{-12\pi} \).

**Correction**: Should be 12PI, not -12PI.
