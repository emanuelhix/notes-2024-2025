tracing out 3-dimensional functions	- trace where x=0	- trace where y=0	- trace interesting points where z=c	- graph the first two, then graph the third & shadedescribe level surfaces	- The level surfaces are a family of parallel planes.	- The level surfaces are a family of ellipsoids.    	- The level surfaces are a family of hyperboloids.		- The level surfaces are a family of hyperbolic cylinders.		- The level surfaces are a family of semiellipsoids.	- The level surfaces are a family of hyperbolic paraboloids.
