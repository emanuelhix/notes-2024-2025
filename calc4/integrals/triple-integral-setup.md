To set up the integral \( \iiint_E 3z \, dV \) where \( E \) is bounded by the cylinder \( y^2 + z^2 = 9 \) and the planes \( x = 0 \), \( y = 3x \), and \( z = 0 \) in the first octant, we first need to determine the boundaries of the region \( E \).

1. **Identify the boundaries**:
   - The cylinder \( y^2 + z^2 = 9 \) implies \( y \) and \( z \) are limited to the values within the circle of radius 3.
   - The plane \( x = 0 \) is the yz-plane.
   - The plane \( y = 3x \) intersects the yz-plane, limiting \( y \) to be a function of \( x \).
   - The plane \( z = 0 \) is the xy-plane.

2. **Determine the region in the first octant**:
   - Since we are in the first octant, all variables \( x, y, z \) must be non-negative.
   - The intersection of \( y = 3x \) and the cylinder defines the upper limit for \( y \) and \( z \).

3. **Finding limits**:
   - The cylinder in the first octant can be described by \( y \) from \( 0 \) to \( 3 \) (since the maximum \( y \) value along the cylinder is 3).
   - For a given \( y \), the corresponding \( z \) values are determined by \( z = \sqrt{9 - y^2} \) (from the cylinder equation).
   - The plane \( y = 3x \) leads to \( x \) being bounded by \( x = \frac{y}{3} \) up to the maximum \( y = 3 \).

4. **Setting up the integral**:
   - The order of integration can be chosen as \( dz \, dy \, dx \).

Thus, we can set up the integral as follows:

\[
\int_{0}^{3} \int_{0}^{\sqrt{9 - y^2}} \int_{0}^{\frac{y}{3}} 3z \, dx \, dz \, dy.
\]

This gives you the required bounds for each variable.
