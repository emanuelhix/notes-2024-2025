c) both (a) and (b)

**Poll 2**

a) True

**Poll 3**

b) False

The query may be slow due to a suboptimal logical or physical design of the database. Typically, the issue lies within the design rather than the Database Management System (DBMS).

_Sometimes_ performance tuning involves upgrading to a more efficient DBMS, but this is not always the case. Therefore, the answer is false.

# Topic 2

**Poll 4**

a) One-to-one relationship

**Poll 5**

b) True

The primary key can indeed consist of more attributes than the super key. This occurs because a super key for an entity \( E \) might simply be \( (ID) \), assuming that \( (ID) \) is sufficient to uniquely identify \( E \).

By combining \( ID \) with additional attributes, we can create new keys such as \( (ID, name) \) or \( (ID, GPA) \) for a _Student_ entity. Since these keys include \( ID \), they can still uniquely identify the student.

The _primary key_ is simply the one we select for our implementation. Thus, itâ€™s possible to designate \( (ID, name) \) as our primary identifier, even though it contains more attributes than the super key \( (ID) \).

b) Adding a multi-valued attribute to Instructor

A multi-valued attribute is one that can hold multiple values. For example, it would be represented as `{phone_numbers}` within the rectangle for the Instructor entity set. This allows us to store multiple phone numbers for each Instructor entity.

**Poll 7**

a) True

**Poll 8**

b) False

An aggregation is employed when we want to establish a relationship with a relationship set.

Skipped !?

**Poll 10**

EMPLOYEE is the relation schema `employee(name, office_number, age)`.

c) (name, office_hours) is the candidate key.

The candidate key is the smallest key possible to uniquely identify an entity.
Name cannot be a key on its own, office_number cannot be a key on its own.

(There is a mistake in the original question, office_hours should be listed as part of the relation schema): `employee(name, office_number, age, office_hours)`
