# Normalization

### Definition

Normalization is the process of ensuring data integrity in a table by eliminating redundant information.

Each normal form corresponds to specific "safety requirements," with 1NF being less stringent compared to higher forms like 3NF or 5NF.

### Benefits

- Tables are smaller, more atomic, and easier to understand.
- Tables are simpler to modify.
- Tables are safeguarded against insertion, deletion, and update anomalies.

## Normal Forms

### First Normal Form (1NF)

### Second Normal Form (2NF)

### Third Normal Form (3NF)

### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
