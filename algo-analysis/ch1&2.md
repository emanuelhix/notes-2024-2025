### Sorting Problem

Given a sequence of `n` numbers `<b_1, b_2, b_3, ..., b_n>`, 
reorder them such that `b'_1 <= b'_2 <= b'_3 <= ... <= b'_n`.

Additionally, a sorting algorithm is considered "correct" if the numbers are returned in this form.

#### Example

Given `<5, 1, 7, 15, 10>`, a correct sorting algorithm produces the sequence `<1, 5, 7, 10, 15>`.

### Correctness (of an algorithm)

In order for an algorithm to be considered "correct," it must satisfy:

- *Always* halts in finite time *on all inputs*
- Outputs the correct solution to the computational problem

# Chapter 2

### Satellite Data

A record (value) associated with the key.

## Insertion Sort

```python
Insertion-Sort(A, n)
	for i = 2 to n:
		key = A[i]
		// Insert A[i] into the sorted subarray A[1 : i - 1]
		j = i - 1
		while j > 0 and A[j] > key
			A[j + 1] = A[j]
			j = j - 1
		A[j + 1] = key
```



### Loop Invariant

A loop invariant is a statement about an algorithm that holds true before the algorithm runs, at each iteration of the algorithm, and after the algorithm runs.
If all of these conditions are met, then the algorithm is considered correct.

This is what is meant by **initialization**, **maintenance**, and **termination**.

For inserrtion sort, the loop invariant is this:

```
At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 1-8, the subarray
A[1 : i - 1]  consists of the elements originally in A[1 : i - 1], but in sorted
order.
```

In other words, at all times, the subarray A[1 : i - 1] is sorted. 

# Chapter 2.2

## Merge Sort

### bottom out / base case conditoin

When in A[q:r], `q=r`. The only time this condition occurs is when there is exactly one element left. That is, A
`A[1:1]`.

Note that  an array with only 1 array is considered to be always sorted. This satisfies one part of the loop invariant.
