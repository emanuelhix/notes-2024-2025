## Definitions

### Sorting Problem

Given a sequence of `n` numbers `<b_1, b_2, b_3, ..., b_n>`, 
reorder them such that `b'_1 <= b'_2 <= b'_3 <= ... <= b'_n`.

Additionally, a sorting algorithm is considered "correct" if the numbers are returned in this form.

#### Example

Given `<5, 1, 7, 15, 10>`, a correct sorting algorithm produces the sequence `<1, 5, 7, 10, 15>`.

### Correctness (of an algorithm)

In order for an algorithm to be considered "correct," it must satisfy:

- *Always* halts in finite time *on all inputs*
- Outputs the correct solution to the computational problem
