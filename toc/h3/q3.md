# Q3

**Claim**: For any language \( A \), let \( A^R = \{w^R \mid w \in A\} \). Prove that if \( A \) is regular, then so is \( A^R \).

### Proof (by ??)

Let \( \Sigma \) be the alphabet for the language \( A \). Define \( A^R = L \), where \( w^R \) is the reverse of any string \( w \in A \).

We know that if \( A \) is regular, it can be represented by a regular expression. Our goal is to show that \( A^R \) is also regular, which means we need to demonstrate that the reverse of a regular language is regular.

#### Base cases:

1. \( L(\emptyset) = \emptyset \) is regular.
2. \( L(\lambda) = \{\lambda\} \) is regular.

#### General case:

For every character \( c \in \Sigma \), \( c \) is a regular expression that generates the singleton set \( \{c\} \).

If \( w^R \) is the reverse of the string \( w = r_1 r_2 \dots r_n \), where each \( r_i \in \Sigma \), we can break \( w^R \) down as the concatenation of the regular expressions \( r_n, r_{n-1}, \dots, r_1 \). Thus:

- The union of regular expressions:  
  \[
  L(r_n + \dots + r_2 + r_1) = L(r_n) \cup \dots \cup L(r_2) \cup L(r_1)
  \] 
  is regular, since the union of regular languages is regular.
  
- The concatenation of regular expressions:  
  \[
  L(r_n r_{n-1} \dots r_1) = L(r_n) L(r_{n-1}) \dots L(r_1)
  \] 
  is regular, since the concatenation of regular languages is regular.

By the closure properties of regular languages (under union and concatenation), the reverse of any regular language \( A \) is also regular. Therefore, \( A^R \) is regular.

\[
\text{QED}
\]
