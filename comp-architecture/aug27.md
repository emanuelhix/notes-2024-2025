### Calculation of Dynamic Power Consumption for a Processor

**Given:**
- Capacitance (\(C\)) = 30 nF = \(30 \times 10^{-9}\) F
- Voltage (\(V\)) = 1.1 V
- Clock Frequency (\(f\)) = 4 GHz = \(4 \times 10^9\) Hz

**Dynamic Power Consumption Equation:**
\[ P = 0.5 \times C \times V^2 \times f \]

**Plugging in the values:**
\[ P = 0.5 \times 30 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{F} \times (1.1 \, \text{V})^2 \times 4 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz} \]

**Calculation:**
\[ P = 0.5 \times 30 \times 10^{-9} \times 1.21 \times 4 \times 10^9 \]
\[ P = 0.5 \times 30 \times 1.21 \times 4 \]
\[ P = 0.5 \times 30 \times 4.84 \]
\[ P = 0.5 \times 145.2 \]
\[ P = 72.6 \, \text{W} \]

**Result:**
The dynamic power consumption for this processor is 72.6 watts.

### Yield Calculation for Semiconductor Wafer

**Given:**
- **Wafer Diameter:** 20 cm (not directly needed for the yield calculation)
- **Defects per Area:** 0.05 defects/cm²
- **Die Area:** 1 cm²

**Yield Formula:**
The yield \( Y \) is calculated using the empirical formula:
\[ Y = \left( \frac{1}{1 + (\text{Defects per area} \times \text{Die area} \times 0.5)} \right)^2 \]

**Steps to Calculate Yield:**

1. **Calculate Defects Contribution:**

   Substitute the given values into the formula:
   - **Defects per Area:** 0.05 defects/cm²
   - **Die Area:** 1 cm²

   \[ \text{Defects Contribution} = \text{Defects per Area} \times \text{Die Area} \times 0.5 \]
   \[ \text{Defects Contribution} = 0.05 \times 1 \times 0.5 = 0.025 \]

2. **Apply the Yield Formula:**

   Substitute the defects contribution into the yield formula:
   \[ Y = \left( \frac{1}{1 + 0.025} \right)^2 \]
   \[ Y = \left( \frac{1}{1.025} \right)^2 \]

3. **Calculate the Yield:**

   \[ Y = \left( \frac{1}{1.025} \right)^2 \]
   \[ Y \approx 0.9756^2 \]
   \[ Y \approx 0.951 \]

4. **Convert to Percentage:**

   \[ \text{Yield} \approx 95.1\% \]

**Notes:**
- **Empirical Derivation:** This formula is derived empirically and approximates the yield based on defect density and die size.
- **Wafer Diameter:** While the wafer diameter is given, it does not affect the yield calculation directly in this formula.

### How to Calculate the Number of Good Dies per Wafer

1. **Determine Total Number of Dies:**
   - **(given) Wafer Area:** 314 cm²
   - **(given) Area per Die:** 1 cm²
   - **Total Dies per Wafer:** \( \frac{314 \text{ cm}^2}{1 \text{ cm}^2 \text{ per die}} = 314 \text{ dies} \)

2. **Calculate the Number of Good Dies:**
   - **(given) Yield Percentage:** 95.2% (expressed as a decimal: 0.952)
   - **Number of Good Dies:** \( \text{Yield Percentage} \times \text{Total Dies} \)
   - **Formula:** \( 0.952 \times 314 \)
   - **Calculation:** \( 299.088 \)

   Therefore, the number of good dies per wafer is approximately **299**.

### Comparing the Performance of Two Computers
Given:
- **Computer A:** 
  - Clock Frequency (F) = 1 GHz
  - Cycles Per Instruction (CPI) = 0.25
- **Computer B:** 
  - Clock Frequency (F) = 2 GHz
  - Cycles Per Instruction (CPI) = 0.6

**Objective:** Determine which computer is faster.

1. **Use the Performance Equation:**
   - Performance = \(\frac{F}{\text{CPI} \times \text{Number of Instructions}}\)

2. **Calculate Performance for Each Computer:**

   - **Computer A:**
     - Performance_A = \(\frac{1 \text{ GHz}}{0.25 \times \text{Number of Instructions}}\)
     - Performance_A = \(\frac{1 \times 10^9}{0.25 \times \text{Number of Instructions}}\)
     - Performance_A = \(\frac{4 \times 10^9}{\text{Number of Instructions}}\)

   - **Computer B:**
     - Performance_B = \(\frac{2 \text{ GHz}}{0.6 \times \text{Number of Instructions}}\)
     - Performance_B = \(\frac{2 \times 10^9}{0.6 \times \text{Number of Instructions}}\)
     - Performance_B = \(\frac{3.33 \times 10^9}{\text{Number of Instructions}}\)

3. **Compare the Performance:**
   - **Speedup** = \(\frac{\text{Performance}_A}{\text{Performance}_B}\)
   - Speedup = \(\frac{4 \times 10^9}{3.33 \times 10^9}\)
   - Speedup \(\approx 1.2X\)

**Conclusion:** Computer A is approximately 1.2 times faster than Computer B.

### Calculating the Average CPI

Given the following data:

| Portion of Program Execution | Cycles Per Instruction (CPI) |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 30%                          | 1                            |
| 10%                          | 5                            |
| 25%                          | 4                            |
| 15%                          | 3                            |
| 20%                          | 2                            |

**Objective:** Calculate the Average CPI.

1. **Convert Percentages to Decimals:**
   - 30% = 0.30
   - 10% = 0.10
   - 25% = 0.25
   - 15% = 0.15
   - 20% = 0.20

2. **Use the Weighted Average Formula:**
   - Average CPI = \( \text{(Portion 1)} \times \text{(CPI 1)} + \text{(Portion 2)} \times \text{(CPI 2)} + \text{(Portion 3)} \times \text{(CPI 3)} + \text{(Portion 4)} \times \text{(CPI 4)} + \text{(Portion 5)} \times \text{(CPI 5)} \)

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   - Average CPI = \( (0.30 \times 1) + (0.10 \times 5) + (0.25 \times 4) + (0.15 \times 3) + (0.20 \times 2) \)
   - Average CPI = \( 0.30 + 0.50 + 1.00 + 0.45 + 0.40 \)
   - Average CPI = \( 2.65 \)

**Conclusion:** The Average CPI is 2.65 cycles per instruction.

### Amdahl's Law

Amdahl's Law provides a formula for determining the maximum improvement in performance of a system when a portion of it is improved. The formula is:

\[ \text{Speedup}_{\text{overall}} = \frac{1}{(1-p) + \frac{p}{S_p}} \]

where:
- \( p \) is the proportion of the system that benefits from the improvement.
- \( S_p \) is the speedup of the improved portion of the system.

**Example Calculation:**

Given:
- \( p = 0.1887 \)
- \( S_p = 5 \)

To find the overall speedup, use the formula:

\[ \text{Speedup}_{\text{overall}} = \frac{1}{(1-0.1887) + \frac{0.1887}{5}} \]

Let's calculate it step-by-step:

1. Calculate \( 1 - p \):
   \[ 1 - 0.1887 = 0.8113 \]

2. Calculate \( \frac{p}{S_p} \):
   \[ \frac{0.1887}{5} = 0.03774 \]

3. Add the results from steps 1 and 2:
   \[ 0.8113 + 0.03774 = 0.84904 \]

4. Finally, take the reciprocal to find the overall speedup:
   \[ \text{Speedup}_{\text{overall}} = \frac{1}{0.84904} \approx 1.18 \]

So, with \( p = 0.1887 \) and \( S_p = 5 \), the overall speedup is approximately 1.18.

### Compiler and Assembly Process

1. **Compiler**: 
   - **Input**: High-level language code (e.g., C++, Java)
   - **Output**: Assembly language code (e.g., "add $0, $5")
   - **Function**: Translates high-level programming language code into assembly language, which is still somewhat human-readable.

2. **Assembler**: 
   - **Input**: Assembly language code
   - **Output**: Machine code (binary code)
   - **Function**: Converts assembly language into machine code, which is a binary representation that the computer's processor can execute.

3. **Linker** (Not within the scope of this course):
   - **Input**: Machine code from multiple object files
   - **Output**: Executable program or library (e.g., .exe, .dll for dynamic libraries, .lib for static libraries)
   - **Function**: Links multiple object files and libraries into a single executable program or library. This process resolves addresses and combines various code and data sections.

### Summary

1. **High-Level Language Code** → **Compiler** → **Assembly Language Code**
2. **Assembly Language Code** → **Assembler** → **Machine Code**
3. **Machine Code** (multiple object files) → **Linker** → **Executable Program or Library**

This process involves translating and combining code from human-readable formats to machine-readable formats, ultimately resulting in executable programs or libraries.
