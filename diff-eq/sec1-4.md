## Notes

### Why does separation of variables work?

dy/dx * h(y) = f(x)

The assumption is that both h(y) and f(x) have antiderivatives, i.e. they are integrable.

Thus, H'(y) = h(y) and F'(x) = f(x).

So,

dy/dx * H'(y) = F'(x) 

Explicitly writing y as a function of x,

d/dx * H'(y(x)) = F'(x) 

This is an application of the chain rule. Namely,
