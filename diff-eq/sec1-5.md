## Verifying Solutions

Since the original equation is in the form \( \frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x) \), we can verify our solution \( y = f(x) \) by first computing its derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} \). Next, we substitute \( f(x) \) into the equation for \( y \), and \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) for its derivative. Finally, we check if both sides of the equation are equal, confirming that our solution satisfies the differential equation.

Given the linear first-order differential equation
$$ \frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x), $$
we verify our solution $ y = f(x) $ by performing the following steps:

1. Compute the derivative of $ y = f(x) $:
$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x). $$

2. Substitute $ y = f(x) $ and $ \frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x) $ into the original equation:
$$ f'(x) + P(x)f(x) = Q(x). $$

3. Check if both sides are equal:
$$ \text{Left-hand side: } f'(x) + P(x)f(x), \quad \text{Right-hand side: } Q(x). $$
If $ f'(x) + P(x)f(x) = Q(x) $, then $ y = f(x) $ is a valid solution.
